Doctor SwifT and HENRY FIELDING, Esq; in the SHADES.
Fielding. OW now, doctor-what the plague is the matter with Lucian, Cervantes, Scarron, and the rest of them at the other side of the fields there-they seem to be actuated by passions which I thought never
troubled breasts in Elysium.
Swift.
THE matter with them - why Mercury has given them a bone to pick, that's all have not you heard of the book he brought down with him last night, in the stage from the upper world-it has set them all a mading-and Cervantes swears it shall be sent to the
( 67 ) the devils, that they may play at rackets with it, as they did with the second part of Don Quixote.
Fielding.
TRISTRAM Shandy I guess you mean1 have been just hearing of it, from a foul which arrived about two hours ago-he tells me that the author is caressed by people of the first fashion-who strive one with each other, for the honour of filling his belly and his pockets - and, withal, that his works are preferr'd beyond any thing which either you or have written;
Swift.
You know I had always a contemptible opinion of those human brutes, and this very circumstance you mention is sufficient to justify my character of the yahoo-for nothing but a yahoo, both in taste and principles, could endure, much less admire such a Paltry performance.
Fielding. AT least, it is a proof to what a low ebb the British genius is reduced; for it is a sign K 2. people
( 68 )
people are poor indeed, when they make a thew with farthings-but it seems you have read the book then.

Swift.
I just run it over, but there was such
pulling among the curious to get it out of my hands-and Mercury says it is the same
thing above stairs too-where he should ne-
ver have got an opportunity to steal it, if he had not watched his time, when one of the most sensible men in the kingdom, and one of the greatest authors - had fallen a sleep over the first volume, so flipt that out of his hand, and tl other from the table by him ; but fhall be surprized if we have them not in plenty before this day twelvemonth, for I think Trisram Shandy must bé dead and buried by that time.
Fielding.
WELL, but prythee Swift, give us some account of the work.

Swift.
In a few words-it is a hotch potch of 
technical terms——broken sentences–– fatir-obscenity-low buffoonery, without
wit-humour-or design.
Fielding.
I beg pardon for interrupting you-but that word low is often given by the sons of dullness to humour the most exquisite-is there no hunour in the book.
Swift.
WOULD you think there was humour—— a blackguard in the street should pull down his breeches and shew you his dirty——If you would, then there is humour in Tris.
tram Shandy.
Fielding.
How the devil can the town be so absurd
then, as to put this man in competition with you and me.
Swift,
( 70)
Swift.
BECAUSE they are a pack of asses-but do not imagine that all do so.--a player that pretends to a taste, perhaps, when he has none-or a rabble of fashionable people may make a noise about him - as a mob often will do about nothing--but the few good judges, Mercury assures me, hold his book. in the contemptible light it deserves.
Fielding. I fancy he owes the success of it to its not being understood.
Swift.
HE does moft certainly-the majority of the world are ignorant- and ignorance whatever face it may put upon it outward-ly, is always conscious-these, therefore, place to their own account-what should be put to that of the author true, they do not understand him-but they never consider that he is not to be understood-in my оріnion, any man who should sit down to write-if, at the same time, he was not absolutely void of what is called the funny | stile, might produce as good a Work-only going
( 7 ) going upon the simple principle, of putting down whatever came into his head.
Fielding.
But it piques my pride a little-that my Tom Jones should be cry’d down for such an upstart-my Tom Jones that cost me so
many years labour.
Swift.
FIELDING, this is no place to fear flattery-the fable of your Tom Jones, setting aside its other merits, which are excessive, is enough to put your fame beyond the reach of the contemptible extollers of Tris. tram Shandy.
Fielding.
MR. Dean, I know you speak what you think-and, because, this is a place where a man cannot be suspected of begging a farther compliment-I do asture you, by what I can learn-your most trifling pamphletnay, one of your letters to doctor Sheridan,
contains more laughable matter than all Tris-
Tram Shandy.
Swift.

Swift, 
-
I must not suffer my judgment to be biasied, there is a sermon in Tristram Shan
-- -- dy; which, to the reserve of somë parts : of the stile, is excellent. But it is introduced, in a manner most improper and irreverent,
Fielding. I do not think we are to be too severe in criticizing works of wit and humour, Or in tying up an entertaining author in such a manner, as not to suffer him to break out now and then into a little jocose merriment, though he should sometimes go beyond even a double entendre. , But an absolute violation of all modesty—to tåke the language of a book from the mouths of the inhabitants of Exeter-street, and Hedge-lane. * * *Caetera desunt.
